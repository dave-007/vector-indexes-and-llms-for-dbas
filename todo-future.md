- Key non-technical topics to share
  - we struggle to keep up, we adapt when things break or change, how we grow
  - communicate early & often, don't go it alone
  - learning is process not a one time event, how can we support the learning process?
  - sharing the learning rather than having all the answers
  - tech choices: azure, postgres, python, vscode, notebooks, repos
  - teaching & learning  from reading and running (and debugging) code
  - While events with new people and content need to be as simple as possible (pre-provisioned labs) As the skill level and familiarity of the team grows, the requirements on the user can increase and still have successful event.
